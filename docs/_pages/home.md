## ⚠️ Caution

MSR X6 is available in two model types: USB and Bluetooth. We strongly recommend purchasing the Bluetooth model type, although it is more expensive. The USB model type is only compatible with Windows and MacOS systems, while the Bluetooth model type can also be used with iOS and Android devices. Choosing the Bluetooth model type ensures maximum compatibility and flexibility across all major operating systems.

Please note: Some Bluetooth model types are labeled as MSRX6BT, while others are simply labeled as MSRX6.
